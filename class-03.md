# Reading 3

Ok, I really wish I had done this reading on time, there were key elements from the reading notes that would have helped me on a lab.  I guess I know where they are now! 

I am intrigued by the box use and want to add it onto my page, the creation of boxes would really help me understand why I find CSS so difficult. 

Loops are going to be confusing until I get help I think, maybe I will sign up for tutoring.  I get the concept when it's in front of me, but when it's abstract thought I draw a blank.
