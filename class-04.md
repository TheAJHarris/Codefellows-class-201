# Reading 4

I finally understand links!! I have been wanting to add some to my page, but have fallen behind due to PC issues and now I really get it I think.

I got to see lorem ipsum again!  The concept amused me in 102, but it makes sense to have a place-holder. I also learned how to align them properly, the layout that is. 

I enjoyed the article on pair programming, I understood this early fortunately.  It's going to take some practice to cement, but I'm excited.
