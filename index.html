    <p>Hi there, I'm AJ and this is my page, I am a New York City native who has traveled the world and tried to soak up as much experience as I could. I'm an avid reader and I also sing.</p>

    <p>I have worked in many different areas, although predominantly I have been in sales and finance for a good portion of it.  Most recently I have been a law enforcement officer, and now hope to become a software engineer.</p>

    Since I'm a foodie, here are some of my favorite foods.
